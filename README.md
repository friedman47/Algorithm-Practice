Practicing algorithms to sharpen my skills, to continue growing as a coder, and to collaborate with others who may be interested. Perhaps most importantly, I'm doing this because it's fun!

I'm planning to code predominantly in JavaScript. I'm working from a book of algorithm problems that will progressively increase in difficulty as I move through it.

If you have suggestions on how I can improve any of my code, I'm eager to hear! At the same time, I also want to struggle through things myself. Right now, my idea is to work off of a development branch, and only push to master when I feel I've got a pretty solid answer. So, if you see something in development that needs tweaking, feel free to let me know if you like, but no spoilers please! If it's in master, then I welcome any feedback or suggestions on alternate approaches, other techniques, optimizations and things of that sort.

Side note: I may decide to create some HTML to make a navigable page to sort through this. But, at the moment, I'm mostly focused on algorithms. Enjoy!
